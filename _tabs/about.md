Welcome! 

My name is Austin and I am the farthest from a developer and hacker as one can get, but this is why I'm here, I love learning new things every day as it's the only thing that can keep me occupied besides volleyball, snowboarding, and photography. Some important facts about me that you need to know: 
- Coffee consumes me as much as I consume it 
- I have a cat named Doorknob 
- I gave John Hammond a fist bump at DefCon31  
- I'm always confused in this field and that's okay :)

Practicionally, I work in a SOC and have many duties on top of its normal traditional triage functions including forensics/incident response, threat hunting, malware analysis, and a little bit of detection engineering and automation. This year I've been diving deep into Windows forensics and incident response, next year is a dedicated year towards red teaming and I'm hoping I can create some useful posts on here to: 
1. Track my progress 
2. Create content for you all to maybe grasp a topic a little better! 

Enjoy!

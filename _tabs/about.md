Welcome! 

My name is Austin and I am the farthest from a developer and hacker as one can get, but this is why I'm here, I love learning new things every day as it's the only thing that can keep me occupied besides volleyball, snowboarding, and photography. Some important facts about me that you need to know: 
- Coffee consumes me as much as I consume it 
- I have a cat named Doorknob 
- I gave John Hammond a fist bump at DefCon31  
- I'm always confused in this field and that's okay :)

Practicionally, I work in a SOC and have many duties on top of its normal traditional triage functions including forensics/incident response, threat hunting, malware analysis, and a little bit of detection engineering and automation. This year, diving deep into Windows forensics and incident response has been a priority, next year is a dedicated year for me to gear more towards red teaming. The past couple years I've been including forensics in my work and filling my time with hacking/recon based CTFs has led me to lay out information to the community that has helped me do my job a little bit better and has made me grow in this industry. I hope you can find something useful! 

Enjoy!
